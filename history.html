        <h1 style="text-align: center">History of "Polio"</h1>
            <p>Polio, or more accurately poliomyelitis is a disease that causes paralysis and death in humans and has plagued mankind since prehistory. <br/>This infectuous disease became more prevelent by 1880s and by 1910 there were frequent epidemics, primarily in urban centers during <br/>the hot season. The epidemic reached its zenith in the 1940s and 1950s and was globally paralizing or killing over half a million people<br/>
            a year. Early treatments ranging from oxygen given to lower extremities, by positive electricty, frequent baths of almond meal (or <br/>oxidizing the water), applications of natural herbs, oils, caffeine, dry muriate of qinine, elixir of cinchone, radium water, cholirde of gold,<br/> liquor calcis and wine of pepsin mostly proved ineffective and it wasn't until the 1916 epidemics that new treatments were divised between <br/>
            1917 and the 50s.</p>
            <p>The iron lung was invented by Philip Drinker, Louis Shaw and James Wilson at Harvard and tested in 1928 at the Boston Children's hospital <br/> It was powered by an electric motor attache to two vaccum cleaners, and worked by changing the pressure inside the machine.<br/> The improved Emerson Iron Lung was in production
            until the 1970s and saved many lives, but the fatality rate for patients with bulbar polio<br/> exceeded 90%.</p>
            <p>Starting in 1935 Maurice Brodie attempted to produce a vaccine, but many patients developed allergic reactions to it, but none of the tested <br/> children developed immunity to polio. In the 40s and 50s a research group, headed by John Enders at Boston Children, successfully cultivated <br/> the poliovirus in human tissue and succeeded in developing a vaccine. By 1957 the US polio cases were reduced from 58,000 to just 5,600.<br/>
            The subsequently developed oral polio vaccine (OPV) by Albert Sabin allowed to reduce the polio cases to only 161 by 1961 and the last <br/>endemic transmission leading to an outbreak in Amish communities in the Midwest occurred in 1979.
            Polio survivors make up the <br/>largest disabled group in the world with 254,000 individual in the US alone. </p>
            <p>Despite the fact that a polio vaccine exists, polio remains endemic in three countries - Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan.</p>

            <h2 style=text-align: left">History of the Roslyn Foundation</h2>
            <p>The Roslyn foundation was initiated on August 13, 2014 by Jake Cortez, Matthew Call and Kazim Agirnas. The name was inspired by the 1916 Roslyn <br/>outbreak in Brooklyn, New York. In it's conceptual stages the foundation has collaborated it's efforts closely with the Global Polio Eradication Innitiative,<br/> Rotary International and the
            American Red Cross to bring local awareness to the gobal persistence of the deadly and crippling polio virus and aims at <br/> generating advocacy and raise, much needed funds to combat the polio virus. Many individuals erronously believe that polio does not pose a local threat, <br/> but nothing could be further from the truth, in this age
            of global communication and rapid transit systems. Therefore, it has been our mission to bring knowledge <br/> and enlightenment on the polio threat to our community, raise awareness and innitiate a greater local and national response to this global threat, which can effects <br/>
            every individual regardless of age, race and creed. The gobal community is currently facing a potential resurgence of a much tougher strand of this deadly virus, <br/>
            if the necessary steps are not taken to prevent a spread in the effected communities in problem regions.</p><br/><br/><br/>
