        </h1>
        <p>We are a non-profit charity founded to assist children and young adults suffering from Polio.

    a rare but severe symptom of polio. </p>
        <p>Our staff members are:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Kazim: Director & Researcher <br /> <img class ="about_pic"src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeCortez/websiteproject20140813/master/images/kazimagirnas.jpg"/> </li> <br />

            <li>Jake: Director & Administrator <br /> <img class ="about_pic"src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeCortez/websiteproject20140813/master/images/jake_pic.JPG"/> </li> <br />
            <p>Jake was born in Chandler, Arizona, USA. His parents moved to Albuquerque New Mexico two years after he was born. He's lived in Rio Rancho for the past 15 years. Jake is fresh out of high school and previously was employed at Rudy's BBQ. One day he decided he wanted to make a change in the world and started developing this website at the Coding Academy at CNM with Matthew and Kazim.</p>
            <li>Matthew: Director & Logistical Supervisor <br /> <img class ="about_pic" src="https://github.com/JakeCortez/websiteproject20140813/raw/40664bbf8ee398dbaafcfabb491eae3a1535807c/images/michael.JPG?raw=true"/> </li> <br />
            <p>Matthew was born in Albuquerque New Mexico, USA.  He lived in Fairbanks Alaska for two years before moving to Las Vegas Nevada.  After living in Vegas for three years, he moved back to Albuquerque and has lived there since.  He has plenty of experience packing and shipping packages, as well as delivering them.  He completed a seasonal stint as a Driver Helper for the United Parcel Service(UPS). </p>
            <li>Dylan: Primary Trustee <br /> <img class ="about_pic" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeCortez/websiteproject20140813/master/images/darth_dylan.jpg"/> </li> <br />
            <p>Dylan first impressed our board of directors with his unique Yerba Mate drinking habbits. The overwhelming sense of trust Dylan instilled in us with his cup, full of fragrent tea, and his outstanding cub lifting techniques, made us instantly appoint him as your primary Trustee. </p>
            <li>Vince: Secondary Trustee <br /> <img class ="about_pic" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeCortez/websiteproject20140813/master/images/vinceduran.jpg"/> </li> <br />
            <p>The appointment of Vincent as our secondary Trustee was much more problematic however and we are still not sure if he will keep his appointment or just switch over to become Albuquerque's first Belly dance judge instead, at which point we would have to appoint someone else. Judging by his suspicious gaze, we assume he will be rejecting his appointment, in favor of his judging career, shortly.</p>
