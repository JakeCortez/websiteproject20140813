                <li>Aid people in USA:
                    <p>Our first goal is to give aid to people with polio in the USA. We want to give help and resources to all affected U.S. citizens. As we do
                    this we will continue to push forward and expand our foundation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Provide our aid worldwide.
                    <p>As we grow, we will spread across the Americas, then across the sea to Africa, Asia, Europe, and India. We will aid the people affected by
                    polio around the world.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Expand services to cover multiple diseases.
                    <p>After we expanded, we want to broaden our scope of diseases. Our foundation is based on Polio now, but as we grow and develope, we will
                    provide aid to people affected by a much larger scope of diseases.</p>
